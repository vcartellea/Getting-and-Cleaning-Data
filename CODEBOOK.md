>Codebook for the project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course, available in Coursera.
>This codebook describes the analysis performed by the `run_analysis.R` script, describing the 
>variables, the data and the transformations performed to clean up the raw data in order to create
>a tidy data set. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with,
>and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
