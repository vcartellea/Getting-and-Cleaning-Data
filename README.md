This repository includes documentation and code for the course project of 'Getting and Cleaning Data',
available in Coursera.

The repository includes the following files:

- A R script named 'run_analysis.R' to prepare a tidy dataset
- A 'README.md' file describing how the script works
- A 'CODEBOOK.md' file describing the variables
- A 'subset.txt' file, which is the tidy dataset created by the run_analysis.R script


The raw dataset used in the analysis can be downloaded from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script (run_analysis.R) works when the data from Samsung Mobiles is inside the unziped folder 
'UCI HAR Dataset' in the working directory.

For detailed information about how the script works refer to 'CODEBOOK.md'.
